I developed a *Newsletter Subscription Web Application* using *Java, JSP, and MySQL*, enabling users to subscribe and unsubscribe from the newsletter subscription. The application features: 

✅ *A user-friendly interface* where users can enter their email to subscribe or unsubscribe. 
✅ *A backend powered by JSP and Java*, handling requests efficiently. 
✅ *MySQL database integration* to store and manage subscriber emails. 
✅ *Automated email generation*, ensuring confirmation messages are sent upon subscription or unsubscription. 
✅ *Live deployment on Apache Tomcat*, making the application accessible online. 
This project enhanced my expertise in *web application development, server-side programming, database management, and live hosting*.
